# clj-jtwig

[Twig](http://twig.sensiolabs.org/) templates in Clojure, provided by [Jtwig](http://jtwig.org). clj-jtwig is a simple
Clojure wrapper around Jtwig to make using it in Clojure applications simple.

For more information on Twig templates, you can refer to the [Twig documentation](http://twig.sensiolabs.org/documentation)
and the [Jtwig documentation](http://jtwig.org/documentation). Please note that Jtwig is not yet a full implementation
of Twig, so some things you see on the Twig documentation might not yet be available in Jtwig, and as a result, not
available in clj-jtwig.

## Usage

**WARNING: This library is still in early development. May not be ready for production use!**

### Leiningen

!["clj-jtwig version"](https://clojars.org/clj-jtwig/latest-version.svg)

#### Java 6

Jtwig targets Java 7 so you can't use it on Java 6. If you are deploying applications into a Java 6 environment and
want to still use clj-jtwig, you can use the version maintained in
[this branch](https://github.com/gered/clj-jtwig/tree/java6). It makes use of an otherwise vanilla Jtwig library
that has been very slightly modified so that it compiles for Java 6. No other changes have been made and this fork is
only being maintained by me *purely* for use with clj-jtwig. *It is not supported by the Jtwig developers.*

### Rendering Templates

Getting up and running with clj-jtwig is easy:

```clojure
(ns yourapp.core
  (:require [clj-jtwig.core :refer [render]]))

(defn say-hello [name]
  (render "Hello {{name}}!" {:name name})
  
(say-hello "Gered")     ; returns "Hello Gered!"
```

You can also render from files by providing a full path and filename to `clj-jtwig.core/render-file`. Most of the time
you'll want to render from a resource file that is bundled along with your app, in which case you can provide a path
and filename relative to the classpath to `clj-jtwig.core/render-resource`.

```clojure
(render-file "/Users/gered/say-hello.twig" {:name "Gered"})

; 'say-hello.twig' in this case would be located at '[your-app]/resources/say-hello.twig'
(render-resource "say-hello.twig" {:name "Gered"})
```

From these examples we can see that the second argument to `render`, `render-file` and `render-resource` is a map of
variables that can be referred to in the template (basically it is the template 'model'). You can nest data and refer
to it using 'dot' syntax like in Java.

```jinja
City of residence: {{address.city}}
```

If a variable's name has any special characters (such as a `-` character), you can access it using 'subscript' syntax
instead.

```jinja
Customer name: {{customer['full-name'}}
```

If a "root" variable has special characters in it's name, you can also access it using the same syntax, but you will
need to access it off of the `model` variable which all variables set in the template are bound to.

```jinja
Order number: {{model['customer-order'].orderNumber}}
```

Otherwise, you normally don't need to include `model`, it is implicit.


### Web Apps

For web apps built on Compojure, you can do something like:

```clojure
(ns yourwebapp.views
  (:require [clj-jtwig.core :refer [render-resource]]
            [clj-jtwig.functions :refer [deftwigfn]]
            [ring.util.response :refer [content-type response]]
            [compojure.response :refer [Renderable]]))

(deftype JtwigRenderable [template-filename params]
  Renderable
  (render [this request]
    (content-type
      (response
        (render-resource
          template-filename
          ; add a var 'context' which contains the current servlet context path which you will
          ; want to prefix on to your css/js/img and other links that you render in your html
          (assoc params :context (or (:context request) ""))))
      "text/html; charset=utf-8")))

; params is an optional map that will get passed to clj-jtwig.core/render-resource. this is will
; need to contain any variables you want to use in 'template-filename'
(defn render [template-filename & [params]]
  (JtwigRenderable. template params))
```

And then in your routes:

```clojure
(ns yourwebapp.routes
  (:use compojure.core)
  (:require [yourwebapp.views :refer [render]]))

(defn home-page []
  ; in this case, 'home.html' would be located at '[yourwebapp]/resources/views/home.html'
  (render "views/home.html" {:name "Gered"}))

(defroutes yourwebapp-routes
  (GET "/" [] (home-page)))
```

### Functions

Adding custom functions is also easy:

```clojure
(ns yourapp.core
  (:require [clj-jtwig.core :refer [render]]
            [clj-jtwig.functions :refer [deftwigfn]]))

(deftwigfn "sayHello" [name]
  (str "Hello " name "!"))
```

Then your functions can be used in your templates:

```clojure
(render "{{ sayHello(name) }}" {:name "Gered"})         ; "Hello Gered!"

; or you can call it using the 'pipe' (filter) syntax
(render "{{ name|sayHello }}" {:name "Gered"})          ; "Hello Gered!"

; you can also nest functions and/or chain filters together
(render "{{ name|upper|sayHello }}" {:name "Gered"})    ; "Hello GERED!"
(render "{{ sayHello(upper(name)) }}" {:name "Gered"})  ; "Hello GERED!"
```

For convenience, you can also define one or more aliases for functions:

```clojure
(ns yourapp.core
  (:require [clj-jtwig.core :refer [render]]
            [clj-jtwig.functions :refer [defaliasedtwigfn]]))

(defaliasedtwigfn "sayHello" [name]
  ["sayHi"]
  (str "Hello " name "!"))
  

; elsewhere in your app's code ...

(render "{{ sayHello(name) }}" {:name "Gered"})         ; "Hello Gered!"
(render "{{ sayHi(name) }}" {:name "Gered"})            ; "Hello Gered!"
```

The `deftwigfn` and `defaliasedtwigfn` are macros that call `clj-jtwig.functions/add-function!` under the hood. If you
prefer, that function can be used directly. Those macros are simply a convenience so you can write template functions
in a 'defn'-style syntax.

#### Standard Library Functions

A number of functions are provided out of the box by Jtwig. A few more are provided to fill in some gaps by clj-jtwig.

## Caching

Jtwig provides support for compiling templates so that subsequent renders can be performed faster. clj-jtwig builds on
this support by providing a very simple caching mechanism when rendering templates from files. Template files are
compiled the first time they are rendered and then the compiled result cached. From then on, each time that same
template file is rendered, the source file on disk is checked to see if it has been modified since it was last cached,
and if so we re-load, compile and cache it before rendering it again.

Caching is turned on by default, but can be turned off if necessary via
`clj-jtwig.core/toggle-compiled-template-caching!`.

An important thing to be aware of when using templates that extend others, or include others is that only the
template who's filename is passed to one of the render functions is checked to see if it has been updated. If your
templates include other template files but those included files are never directly rendered themselves, then they will
not get recompiled and cached unless the parent template is updated as well. This can be a problem during development
of an application, so you may want to turn caching off during development.

## Debugging Tips

One other helpful use of `model` is for debugging when working with a lot of data being passed to a template. You can
dump the entire set of variables passed to the template using the `dump` function.

```jinja
{{model|dump}}
```
