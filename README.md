# clj-jtwig

[Twig](http://twig.sensiolabs.org/) templates in Clojure, provided by [Jtwig](http://jtwig.org). clj-jtwig is a simple
Clojure wrapper around Jtwig to make using it in Clojure applications simple. It also provides some extra functions on 
top of the standard library that Jtwig provides. As well, it adds a simple template caching layer that works 
out-of-the-box when rendering templates from files.

For more information on Twig templates, you can refer to the [Twig documentation](http://twig.sensiolabs.org/documentation)
and the [Jtwig documentation](http://jtwig.org/documentation). Please note that Jtwig is not yet a full implementation
of Twig, so some things you see on the Twig documentation might not yet be available in Jtwig, and as a result, not
available in clj-jtwig.

## Usage

**WARNING: This library is still in early development. May not be ready for production use!**

### Leiningen

[See Clojars for the up to date `project.clj` dependency line](https://clojars.org/clj-jtwig)

#### Java 6

Jtwig targets Java 7 so you can't use it on Java 6. If you are deploying applications into a Java 6 environment and
want to still use clj-jtwig, you can use the version maintained in
[this branch](https://github.com/gered/clj-jtwig/tree/java6). It makes use of an otherwise vanilla Jtwig library
that has been very slightly modified so that it compiles for Java 6. No other changes have been made and this fork is
only being maintained by me *purely* for use with clj-jtwig. *It is not supported by the Jtwig developers.*

[See Clojars for the up to date `project.clj` dependency line](https://clojars.org/clj-jtwig-java6)

### Rendering Templates

Getting up and running with clj-jtwig is easy:

```clojure
(use 'clj-jtwig.core)

(render "Hello {{name}}!" {:name "Gered"})   ; returns "Hello Gered!
```

You can also render templates from files:

```clojure
(render-file "/Users/gered/say-hello.twig" {:name "Gered"})

; 'say-hello.twig' in this case would be located at '[your-app]/resources/say-hello.twig'
(render-resource "say-hello.twig" {:name "Gered"})
```

As we can see above, there are 3 main template rendering functions, `render`, `render-file` and `render-resource`.
`render-resource` is probably what you will use most often. The file path you provide to this function is relative
to the classpath, and so is ideal for rendering templates bundled with your application.

All three "render" functions take a second parameter which is a map that contains the values to pass to the template 
which can then be referred to in the template by name. This map is also referred to as the "model map."

Nested variables can be referred to using "dot" syntax like in Java:

```clojure
(render "Hello {{person.name}}!" {:person {:name "Gered"}})   ; returns "Hello Gered!
```

You can only use "dot" syntax like in the above example when your variable names do not include any special characters
in them. For Clojure programmers, this also includes the use of hyphens in variable names. To get around this you can
use "subscript" syntax instead:

```clojure
(render "Hello {{person['first-name']}}!" {:person {:first-name "Gered"}})   ; returns "Hello Gered!
```

If your root-level variables in the model map contain special characters, you can still access them by using the
same "subscript" syntax off of the automatically added `model` variable that is passed to all templates:

```clojure
(render "Hello {{model['first-name']}}!" {:first-name "Gered"})   ; returns "Hello Gered!
```

### Web Apps

For web apps built on [Ring](https://github.com/ring-clojure/ring) and [Compojure](https://github.com/weavejester/compojure), 
you can do something like:

```clojure
(ns yourwebapp.views
  (:require [clj-jtwig.core :refer [render-resource]]
            [ring.util.response :refer [content-type response]]
            [compojure.response :refer [Renderable]]))

(deftype JtwigRenderable [template-filename params]
  Renderable
  (render [this request]
    (-> (render-resource template-filename params)
        (response)
        (content-type "text/html; charset=utf-8"))))

; params is an optional map that will get passed to clj-jtwig.core/render-resource. this is will
; need to contain any variables you want to use in 'template-filename'
(defn render [template-filename & [params]]
  (JtwigRenderable. template-filename params))
```

And then in your routes:

```clojure
(ns yourwebapp.routes
  (:use compojure.core)
  (:require [yourwebapp.views :refer [render]]))

(defn home-page []
  ; in this case, 'home.html' would be located at '[yourwebapp]/resources/views/home.html'
  (render "views/home.html" {:name "Gered"}))

(defroutes yourwebapp-routes
  (GET "/" [] (home-page)))
```

You will also probably want to add `clj-jtwig.web.middleware/wrap-servlet-context-path` to your 
[Ring middleware](https://github.com/ring-clojure/ring/wiki/Concepts#middleware) so that template functions such as 
`path`, `javascript` and `stylesheet` can automatically prepend the servlet context path to urls you provide to your 
web app's resources.

If you need to output the servlet context path in one of your templates (e.g. for use with Javascript code that 
performs AJAX requests), then you can either update the `render` function example provided above to `assoc` the value 
of `clj-jtwig.web.middleware/*servlet-context-path*` to the `params` map. Then you can refer to this value in your 
templates the same way as any other value you pass in. Or you can do something like this in one of your templates:

```html
<script type="text/javascript">
  var context = "{{ path('/') }}";
</script>
```

Which will make a global variable `context` available to your Javascript code which will have the value of the servlet 
context path.

### Functions

Adding custom functions is easy:

```clojure
(use 'clj-jtwig.functions)

(deftwigfn "sayHello" [name]
  (str "Hello " name "!"))
```

Then your functions can be used in your templates:

```clojure
(render "{{ sayHello(name) }}" {:name "Gered"})         ; "Hello Gered!"

; or you can call it using the 'pipe' (filter) syntax
(render "{{ name|sayHello }}" {:name "Gered"})          ; "Hello Gered!"

; you can also nest functions and/or chain filters together
(render "{{ name|upper|sayHello }}" {:name "Gered"})    ; "Hello GERED!"
(render "{{ sayHello(upper(name)) }}" {:name "Gered"})  ; "Hello GERED!"
```

For convenience, you can also define one or more aliases for functions:

```clojure
(defaliasedtwigfn "sayHello" [name]
  ["sayHi"]
  (str "Hello " name "!"))
  
(render "{{ sayHello(name) }}" {:name "Gered"})         ; "Hello Gered!"
(render "{{ sayHi(name) }}" {:name "Gered"})            ; "Hello Gered!"
```

The `deftwigfn` and `defaliasedtwigfn` are macros that call `clj-jtwig.functions/add-function!` under the hood. If you
prefer, that function can be used directly. Those macros are simply a convenience so you can write template functions
in a 'defn'-style syntax.

#### Standard Library Functions

A number of functions are provided out of the box by Jtwig. A few more are provided by clj-jtwig to fill in some gaps. 
The following is a list of all the functions available with clj-jtwig.

| to_long | `to_long(string)`<br/>Converts the string to a long value.
| to_string | `to_string(value)`<br/>Converts the value to a string representation. This walks over all values in a collection, causing lazy sequences to be fully evaluated.
| trim | `trim(string)`<br/>Strips whitespace (or other characters) from the beginning and end of a string.
| upper | `upper(string)`<br/>Converts a value to uppercase.
| url_encode | `url_encode(string)`<br/>`url_encode(map)`<br/>Percent encodes a given string as a URL segment or a map of key/values as a query string (e.g. in a `key=value&key=value ...` format).

## Options

clj-jtwig has a few global options that affect template parsing and rendering behaviour. You can adjust the options
by calling `clj-jtwig.core/set-options!` and passing in only the keys/values you want to change.

#### `:cache-compiled-templates`
Default is ON.

Whether or not to cache compiled templates. Caching is discussed in the next section.

#### `:skip-file-status-checks`
Default is OFF.

Whether or not to continue checking file modification times each time a template file is rendered *after* the first 
time it is compiled and cached. This option can be turned on to avoid extra file I/O (which is likely to be very 
minor anyway), but it means that after templates are first cached, any subsequent updates to the template files will 
not trigger the cached copy to be updated. If caching is disabled, this option is ignored.

#### `:check-for-minified-web-resources`
Default is ON.

If turned on, the `stylesheet` and `javascript` template functions will automatically check for an equivalent
similarly named .css/.js file with a .min.css/.min.js file extension and if found, render a link/script html tag
with that filename instead. This option is intended to be turned off during development and only turned on in
production builds to help simplify automatic switching between minified and development copies of css/js resources.

#### `:auto-convert-map-keywords`
Default is ON.

If turned on, the model map passed to any of the "render" functions will have any keyword keys converted to strings.
As well, custom template function parameters and return values that are maps containing keyword keys will also
have their keys converted to strings and vice-versa as necessary. This is an "all or nothing" type of option, so
you should probably turn this off if the maps you need to pass to templates will need to contain a mix of keyword
and string keys. This option is intended to make writing more idiomatic Clojure code against clj-jtwig easier to do
given that Jtwig is a Java library that has no concept of Clojure keywords. This option is discussed in more detail
below.

## Caching

Jtwig provides support for compiling templates so that subsequent renders can be performed faster. clj-jtwig builds on
this support by providing a very simple caching mechanism when rendering templates from files. Template files are
compiled the first time they are rendered and then the compiled result cached. From then on, each time that same
template file is rendered, the source file on disk is checked to see if it has been modified since it was last cached.
If it has been we re-load, compile and cache it before rendering it again. As long as the file has not been modified 
the previously compiled result is re-used.

Caching is turned on by default, but can be turned off if necessary via the `:cache-compiled-templates` option.

An important thing to be aware of when using templates that extend others, or include others is that only the
template who's filename is passed to one of the render functions is checked to see if it has been updated. If your
templates include other template files but those included files are never directly rendered themselves, then they will
not get recompiled and cached unless the parent template is updated as well. This can be a problem during development
of an application, so you may want to turn caching off during development.

## Jtwig is a Java library. What does that mean for Clojure?

Jtwig is written in Java. Model maps in Jtwig are represented by a `HashMap<String, Object>` [as can be seen here](https://github.com/lyncode/jtwig/blob/master/jtwig-core/src/main/java/com/lyncode/jtwig/JtwigModelMap.java).
Right away, this has an important implication for idiomatic Clojure code: Keywords are typically used as the keys for
maps, and obviously you can't directly add a `clojure.lang.Keyword` as the key to a `HashMap<String, Object>`. Just
calling `.toString` isn't good enough here either.

There are two immediate options to get around this problem:

* Automatically convert the keys in all maps passed to Jtwig to use strings instead of keywords. And then do this again
  when map values are passed by Jtwig to custom template functions and then back again when map values are returned
  from custom template functions. We use the Clojure `name` and `keyword` functions for this to/back conversion.
* Do nothing and force the application to use strings for all map keys.

There are pros and cons to each approach. Unfortunately there is no 100% perfect solution.

Out of the box, clj-jtwig is configured for the first approach, but that comes with certain assumptions about the maps
that you will be using with Jtwig. Specifically, if your application uses maps that contain a mix of key types (both
keywords *and* strings), then the automatic conversions will likely cause problems for you. You can toggle this
automatic conversion on/off via the `:auto-convert-map-keywords` option.

To demonstrate the problem:

```clojure
(use 'clj-jtwig.core)

(set-options! :auto-convert-map-keywords false)

(render "Hello {{name}}!" {:name "Gered"})                      ; throws a ClassCastException
(render "Hello {{name}}!" {"name" "Gered"})                     ; "Hello Gered!"
(render "Hello {{person.name}}!" {"person" {:name "Gered"}})    ; "Hello null!"

; this is the default setting
(set-options! :auto-convert-map-keywords true)

(render "Hello {{name}}!" {:name "Gered"})                      ; "Hello Gered!"
(render "Hello {{name}}!" {"name" "Gered"})                     ; "Hello Gered!"
(render "Hello {{person.name}}!" {"person" {:name "Gered"}})    ; "Hello Gered!"
```

This same type of problem also applies to variables passed to custom template functions. A trivial example:

```clojure
(use 'clj-jtwig.core)
(use 'clj-jtwig.functions)

(deftwigfn "get_map" [name]
  {:name name})

(set-options! :auto-convert-map-keywords false)

(render "Hello {{get_map(name).name}}!" {"name" "Gered"})       ; "Hello null!"

; this is the default setting
(set-options! :auto-convert-map-keywords true)

(render "Hello {{get_map(name).name}}!" {:name "Gered"})        ; "Hello Gered!"
```

The decision was made to have `:auto-convert-map-keywords` on by default as usually in Clojure code you will be using
keywords in all your maps while strings for keys are rarely used (if ever) in a typical Clojure application.

## Debugging Tips

You can dump all of the values passed to the template by using the `dump` function, passing it the automatically
added `model` variable:

```jinja
{{model|dump}}
```

For any tabular values, you can also use `dump_table` to get a nice ASCII table display of each row of data.

Jtwig's error reporting (e.g. in the case of a parser error) is poor right now unfortunately. There's not much that
can be done except for making sure you frequently test your templates as you write them. Error reporting is expected
to be greatly improved in the next major release.
