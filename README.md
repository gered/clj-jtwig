# clj-jtwig

[Twig](http://twig.sensiolabs.org/) templates in Clojure, provided by [Jtwig](http://jtwig.org). clj-jtwig is a simple
Clojure wrapper around Jtwig to make using it in Clojure applications simple.

**This is the Java 6 branch.** It is identical in every way to the master branch, except for the use of a version of
Jtwig that has been very slightly modified to be Java 6 compatible.

[Please see the master branch for more information about clj-jtwig.](https://github.com/gered/clj-jtwig)
