     ; true/false to enable/disable file status checks (existance of file and last modification
     ; date/time check). if true, these checks will be skipped ONLY if a compiled template for
     ; the filepath given is cached already. if this is true and an attempt is made to render
     ; a template which is not yet cached, these checks will still be run (this is to ensure that
     ; templates can still be loaded and compiled the first time they are rendered).
     ; if caching is completely disabled (via the above option), then this setting is ignored and
     ; file status checks will always be performed.

     ; templates will not be modified/deleted after they are first compiled and you want to skip
     ; any unnecessary file I/O.

     ; will check first to see if there is a '.min.js' or '.min.css' file with the same beginning
     ; part of the filename, and if so use that file instead.

     ; having to do any manual conversions yourself and to keep your Clojure code as idiomatic
     ; as possible. Jtwig model-maps at the very least do require all the keys to be strings
     ; (not keywords) to ensure that model-map value resolution works as expected.
