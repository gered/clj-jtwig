; we are using a separate map to hold the standard functions instead of using deftwigfn, etc. because doing it this
; way makes it easy to re-add all these functions when/if the JTwig function repository object needs to be
; recreated (e.g. during unit tests).

; the keys are function names. each value is a map containing :fn which is the actual function, and an optional
; :aliases, which should be a vector of strings containing one or more possible aliases for this function.
